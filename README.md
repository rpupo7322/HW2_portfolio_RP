# HW2_portfolio_RP

This is the second homework assignment of the bootcamp, showing a sample personal portfolio page including information about me, various applications that I have built, and a section with contact info. In addition to these broad content categories, I have also included the following features:

WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

Applications shown:
1. The Dawn Patrol - A surf forecast displaying current and upcoming weather & tide information for key surf locations on the NC coast. My primary contribution to this project involved connecting to the Surfline API and building the central surf forecast display.

2. Password Generator - This application allows the user to select from a series of parameters to generate a randomized password displayed on the webpage.
